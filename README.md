## Facial Recognition Technology

Facial recognition systems are a technology that matches a human face from a digital image against a database of faces. Advances in facial recognition technology have opened up many privacy concerns. In this assignment, I will discuss two articles debating on facial recognition technology.


## Article 1

In Amnesty International's [Ban dangerous facial recognition technology that amplifies racist policing] (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/ban-dangerous-facial-recognition-technology-that-amplifies-racist-policing/), the author calls for a ban on the use of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance. The author exclaims that the technology disproportionately impacts people of color because facial recognition technology has racial biases. Although face recognition algorithms have high accuracy rates, research shows that these outcomes are not universal across demographic groups. There is a higher risk of faulty facial recognition among black communities. I agree with the author that the racial bias in the facial recognition system is an important issue. 

I believe the author made valid claims against facial recognition technology. Law enforcement have used face recognition to monitor and identify Black Lives Matter protestors. Facial recognition systems also raise privacy concerns because it collects information from various private sources such as social media accounts or even photo identification cards. 

## Article 2

In New York Times’s [A Case for Facial Recognition] (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/technology/facial-recognition-software-police.html), the author makes an opposing claim to the first article. It states that facial recognition systems can be an effective tool to ensure public safety if it has proper regulations. For example, Detroit passed a policy last year that place regulations on law enforcement’s use of facial recognition. These regulations include limiting the use of facial recognition systems to violent crimes, multiple approvals required for its use, and added layers of protection against faulty matches. James Tate, a member of the Detroit City council, voted for the use of facial recognition technology because he also believed that with proper guidelines, the technology is a helpful crime-fighting tool. I agree that the facial recognition system needs more regulations before it is used. 

Advances in facial recognition technology will inevitably lead to privacy concerns. Both articles addressed the concerns of facial recognition technology and the misuse of databases by law enforcement. I think that limiting the use of facial recognition technology will help the technology gain wider acceptance.  I also believe that facial recognition algorithms need more improvements such as eliminating any racial biases. With the advancement of modern technology, the issues around databases and the use of databases will inevitably be more prominent in the years ahead.
